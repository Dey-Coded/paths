# paths
Path publishers for testing path trackers

Run the python codes over ROS to get the desired path with the message of nav_msgs/Path type(http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Path.html). The offsets could be changed from the code or alternatively change the offset position of the vehicle in Gazebo(or whatever simulator in use).
